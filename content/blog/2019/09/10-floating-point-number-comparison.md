This post summarizes my thoughts after doing a code review which involved
testing outputs containing several small floating point numbers.

The code was written in Python 2/3, and uses both plain builtin floats as well
as NumPy arrays of floats.

A good reading on the topic was [Comparing Floating Point
Numbers, 2012
Edition](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/),
by Bruce Dawson.
