[XMPPVOX](http://xmppvox.rodolfocarvalho.net) is a chat client for blind
computer users.

It literally breaks barries, as it enables visually impaired people to
communicate with their peers in a transparent way, by means of Text-to-Speech
and a specially-crafted command interface.

With XMPPVOX, it doesn't matter whether you're blind or not, nor whether you're
talking to someone who also uses XMPPVOX or any other chat client.

Behind the scenes, it is multiplatform adhoc-proprietary-protocol-to-XMPP
bridge that connects [DOSVOX](http://intervox.nce.ufrj.br/dosvox/) users to
XMPP networks. Since DOSVOX is available on Windows only, XMPPVOX is currently
distributed as a single Windows executable.
