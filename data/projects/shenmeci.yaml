  [Shenmeci](http://shenmeci.rodolfocarvalho.net) is a Chinese-English-Chinese
  online dictionary.

  <img src="imgs/shenmeci.png" alt="Shenmeci screenshot" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail">

  With Chinese text as input, it does a dictionary based word segmentation
  (Chinese has no whitespace) and provides translation for each word.

  For non-Chinese input it searches for entries in the dictionary quickly using
  a full-text index.
