  The [Coding Dojo Rio](https://dojorio.org) was started in late 2008 and is
  pure reason to smile :-)

  DojoRio is the first open Coding Dojo group in the state of Rio de Janeiro,
  Brazil. It grew big, has had several branches in the city and state, and even
  influenced the creation of new Coding Dojos around Brazil and the world!

  It's a weekly event in which people exchange knowledge and practice
  programming techniques and soft skills. At this point, it is certainly one of
  the oldest uninterrupted coding dojos in existence around the world.
